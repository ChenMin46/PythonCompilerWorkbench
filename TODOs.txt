Known bugs:

- byteplay doesn't seem to properly display the bytecode of function
  definitions, nor does it recurse into function defs to print out their
  bytecodes
  - ohhh, are those byteplay code objects as well, so you can recurse
    into them?!? that would be sweeeet

- also see if we can get line numbers from the AST
  - rishabh says that we should be able to get column numbers and token
    extents (lengths) as well
  - lots of kinds of AST nodes (but not all of them!) have lineno and
  col_offset fields
